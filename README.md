**ORIGINSEAL v0.0.0** is an origin primitive.

It does not decide.
It does not verify.
It does not witness.
It does not execute.
It does not enforce.

It **seals origin**.

ORIGINSEAL exists to mark the first irreversible moment something comes into being.

---

## Philosophy

Most disputes do not begin at failure.
They begin at origin.

ORIGINSEAL exists to answer a question that must only be answered once:

> **Where did this come from, originally?**

Not who claims it now.
Not who modified it later.
Not who interprets it.

Only origin.

Once sealed, origin cannot be replaced.

---

## What ORIGINSEAL Is

ORIGINSEAL is a **provenance primitive**.

It binds:

* Initial input (stdin)
* Repository identity
* Timestamp
* First observer context

Into a single, immutable origin record.

The result is **genesis evidence**.

---

## What It Is Not

* Not a verifier
* Not a validator
* Not a judge
* Not a witness of ongoing state
* Not a versioning system
* Not an access control mechanism

Anything that evaluates, modifies, or approves content is out of scope.

---

## Behavior

* Consumes input exclusively via `stdin`
* Refuses silent invocation
* Requires explicit declaration of origin intent
* Records the first sealing event only
* Appends origin records to an immutable ledger
* Emits exactly one verdict
* Exits immediately after sealing

No retries.
No flags.
No configuration.

---

## Verdicts

ORIGINSEAL emits exactly one of the following:

* `SEALED` — origin successfully recorded
* `DENIED` — origin cannot be sealed (invalid or ambiguous)

The verdict concerns **genesis**, not correctness.

---

## Usage

ORIGINSEAL is never run casually.
It is invoked only at the moment of creation.

```sh
<origin-context> | ./originseal.sh
```

### Example

```sh
echo "initial publication of artifact" | ./originseal.sh
```

If origin conditions are satisfied:

```text
SEALED
```

If origin is ambiguous or already sealed:

```text
DENIED
```

---

## Contract

Once sealed:

* Origin is fixed
* Later claims are subordinate
* Disputes shift from authorship to custody
* Responsibility attaches permanently

ORIGINSEAL guarantees **non-replaceable origin**.

---

## Relationship to Other Artifacts

* **GUILLOTINE** — executes
* **IRREVOCULL** — judges
* **ATTESTORIUM** — witnesses
* **VALIDEXOR** — verifies
* **LIMENWARD** — guards transitions
* **ORIGINSEAL** — seals genesis

Each artifact occupies exactly one irreversible role.
None overlap.

---

## Warning

Sealing origin creates ownership gravity.

Once sealed, you cannot claim ignorance.
You cannot claim coincidence.
You cannot claim replacement.

That is the point.

---

## About

ORIGINSEAL is a minimal, deterministic origin-sealing primitive for irreversible systems.

If origin does not matter, do not use it.
If it does, nothing else is sufficient.
